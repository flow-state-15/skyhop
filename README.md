# Skyhop
Skyhop is a website where you can rent airplanes! This is a personal project and inspired by AirBnB. Users can view, book and review listings, as well as interact with listings they submit. There is a demo user feature for your navigating pleasure. 

Built using Javascript, HTML, CSS, React and Redux. You can build the site by running npm install in the root, frontend and backend folders. All test seed data will procedurally generate. 

You can visit the live site by navigating to https://skyhop.herokuapp.com/
